# nPrintML-on-IoT

## Description
Apply [nPrintML](https://nprint.github.io/) on IoT dataset, details in the lab report.

## Dataset
- **iot_six**: 6 different IoT devices. Four of them are smart TVs: Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV, Roku TV, and Samsung TV. 
Two of them are home assistants: Google Home and Amazon Echo Dot. Each device has 30 distinct pcap files and each pcap file contains 10 packets.

- **iot_two_large**: Google Home and Amazon Echo Dot, 46 pcap files for Amazon Echo Dot and 47 pcap files for Google Home. The pcap files are captured every 15 seconds, and the numbers of packets in each pcap file are different. 

- **iot_two_nomac_large**: Same pcap files as "iot_two_large" dataset, but remove all the mac address.

- **iot_two_small**: Google Home and Amazon Echo Dot, 30 pcap files for both device and each pcap file has exactly 10 packets.

- **iot_two_nomac_small**: Same pcap files as "iot_two_small" dataset, but remove all the mac address.

- **webrtc25**: Discord, Facebook, Google, Snowflake; 25 pcap files for each application.
